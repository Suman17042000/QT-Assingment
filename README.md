# QT-Assingment
# what has been done
I have made a basic text-editing app with the functionalites of changing font-size,font-weight and font-family,subscript and superscript as well.

# Issues And Challenges
1.Kit:- During the installation I didnt download the desktop kit and I didn't have any idea of how to make kit manually so I have to reinstall it which consumed lots of my time.

2.Newbie:-As It was my first time I was using this software So It was quite tough for me to become familiar with the codes and the software too.


# Features
Build a basic text-editing app with bold/unbold of an individual text.

Implement the superscript like this and subscript like this functionality
